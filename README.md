# Internals
Internals is an upcoming library for manipulating CraftBukkit internals.

## What is it?
As stated above, it will be a library which will be used for manipulating CraftBukkit internals which are not supported by the Bukkit API.
What are these 'internals?' Well, a few examples would be packet construction and injection and merchant inventories which are not supported by Bukkit, but desired by many.
